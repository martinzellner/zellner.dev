The Annapurna Circuit begins in the village of Bhulbhule (840m), where the trail gently ascends through fertile rice paddies and banana trees, offering trekkers a glimpse of Nepal’s agricultural heartland. Over the first three days, covering 46 kilometers, the trail follows the Marsyangdi River, with the landscape evolving from lush green fields to steeper, rockier terrain as you enter the foothills of the Himalayas.

This lower section of the trek is often bypassed by many hikers, making it a quieter experience where guesthouses are especially welcoming, grateful for the opportunity to host travelers. The Annapurna region is known for its warm hospitality, and a signature dish that most trekkers can’t resist is the famous apple pie, a comforting treat at the end of a long day on the trail.

As the altitude increases, the scenery becomes more dramatic, with distant snow-capped peaks coming into view, signaling the start of the true mountain adventure. Reaching the village of Chame (2670m), the administrative center of the Manang district, you’re greeted by the towering Annapurna II and the promise of even greater challenges ahead. Before continuing, a visit to the natural hot springs provides a much-needed break, easing tired muscles and allowing for some relaxation in a stunning alpine setting.
